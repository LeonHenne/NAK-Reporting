  abstract  = {This book constitutes the proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Sciences, RCIS 2020, held in Limassol, Cyprus, during September 23-25, 2020. The conference was originally scheduled in for 2020, but the organizing committee was forced to postpone the conference due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The scope of RCIS 2020 is summarized by the thematic areas of information systems and their engineering; user-oriented approaches; data and information management; business process management; domain-specific information systems engineering; data science; information infrastructures, and reflective research and practice. The 26 full papers and 3 work in progress papers presented in this volume were carefully reviewed and selected from 106 submissions. They were organized in topical sections named: Data Analytics and Business Intelligence; Digital Enterprise and Technologies; Human Factors in Information Systems; Information Systems Development and Testing; Machine Learning and Text Processing; and Security and Privacy. The volume also contains 12 poster and demo-papers, and 4 Doctoral Consortium papers.},

@article{Pratt.2023,
  abstract = {There is a widespread stated desire amongst both public and private organizations worldwide to engage in more significant ``evidence-based reasoning'' and to be more ``data-driven.'' We argue that these two goals are proxies for the often-unstated goal of improving the exploration of possible futures as foresights that could lead to better strategic decisions and improved business outcomes. From this perspective, data and analytics hold great promise and are necessary---but not sufficient---for improving strategic decision-making. Something more is needed to realize this potential. We specify how to fill this gap using an integration framework between technology and decision-makers, which is especially appropriate in complex and/or volatile environments. Our solution---which comprises a methodology as well as a software architecture---therefore unifies not only human decision makers to technology but each other and also integrates several disciplines that have been hitherto unnecessarily separated. Thereby, it could help organizations to address increasing challenges better as well as improve the exploration of possible futures.},
